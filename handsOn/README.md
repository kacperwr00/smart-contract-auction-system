This directory should contain mulitple hello world style smart contract applications (possibly with both transaction processors and client interface) developed with different block chains to help me choose the right one for the main application

Currently considered blockchains include:
<ul>
    <li>Polkadot:
        <ul>
            <li> ðŸ”´ a ðŸ”´ </li>
            <li> âœ… b âœ… </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Solana
        <ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>EOS
        <ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Hyperledger Sawtooth
        <ul>
            <li> âœ… supports both its own smart contracts and ethereum ones âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… PBFT, PoET, Raft and devmode consensus algorithms all available and it's possible to change them after a blockchain has been created âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… Python, Go, Javascript, Rust âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… Examples, reasonably documented âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… HTTP/JSON client interface âœ… </li>
            <li> ðŸ”´ permissioned (private) networks only ðŸ”´ </li>
            <li> ðŸ”´ perforamnce and scalability depend on implementation, but can't rival the likes of solana ðŸ”´ </li>
            <li> ðŸ”´ no PoW or PoS ðŸ”´ </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

Ethereum is not considered because of the upcoming merge (which may or may not break the application), as well as (currently?) ridiculous fees, transaction speed and scalability
