# Choosing the stack

This directory should contain mulitple hello world style smart contract applications (possibly with both transaction processors and client interface) developed with different block chains to help me choose the right one for the main application

## Possible approcaches

We could write smart contracts targetting a public, established blockchain and deploy it, like Ethereum, EOS or Solana. Then the client might use the ready to use interfaces to use these smart contracts in order to deploy transactions to the blockchain. This is a much simpler approach - we would not have to worry about consensus, safety or speed - at least not beyond choosing the right blockchain for the application. On the other I would not be able to take credit for these aspects, and they seem more interesting than creating a client or a GUI. These blockchain also enforce fees or use of a testnet.

We could also create our own blockchain - it's actually quite simple to implement a Bitcoin-style blockchain, especially using a good crypto library. Creating an EVM-style blockchain though, that could execute smart contracts would be a much bigger undertaking. A solution that I am partial to right now would be to use a framework providing the ability to create private blockchains, preferably one from the Hyperledger Project.

Currently considered blockchains and their pros/cons include:
<ul>
    <li>Solana
        <ul>
            <li> âœ… proof of history and proof of stake - makes it easier to agree on the order of the actions on the shared ledger - can be crucial for an auction system; also reduces overhead at the same time âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… b âœ… </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>EOS
        <ul>
            <li> âœ… It's possible to deploy a smart contract with as few lines of code - simplicity (hello world example smart contract contains 6 lines) âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… Speed / scalability âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… C++ âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… Great wallet/account/auth included âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… Easy to work with; decent documentation âœ… </li>
            <li> ðŸ”´ dPoS - quite centralized, not as private or safe ðŸ”´ </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Hyperledger Sawtooth
        <ul>
            <li> âœ… supports both its own smart contracts and ethereum ones âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… PBFT, PoET, Raft and devmode consensus algorithms all available and it's possible to change them after a blockchain has been created âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… Python, Go, Javascript, Rust âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… Examples, reasonably documented âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… HTTP/JSON client interface âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… Based on Transaction batches - which might help build a fair auction system âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… considered safe âœ… </li>
            <li> âœ… supports custom payload formats âœ… </li>
            <li> ðŸ”´ outdated both in documentation and code; doesn't support new Ubuntu or python versions; causes headaches all day long ðŸ”´ </li>
            <li> ðŸ”´ working with it was honestly dreadful ðŸ”´ </li>
            <li> ðŸ”´ more code / work required compared to deploying smart contracts to an existing chain ðŸ”´ </li>
            <li> ðŸ”´ permissioned networks only (kind of. Either way privacy and openess is not it's strong suit) ðŸ”´ </li>
            <li> ðŸ”´ perforamnce and scalability depend on implementation, but can't rival the likes of solana (yet still, the likes of Etheruem can't rival sawtooth's performance - at least at the time of writing) ðŸ”´ </li>
            <li> ðŸ”´ no PoW or PoS ðŸ”´ </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Hyperledger Fabric
        <ul>
            <li> âœ… supports both its own smart contracts and ethereum ones âœ… </li>
            <li> ðŸ”´ unfortunately does not include an SDK in any of the civilized languages yet - go could work ðŸ”´ </li>
            <li> ðŸ”´ more code / work required compared to deploying smart contracts to an existing chain ðŸ”´ </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Polkadot and Monero:
        <ul>
            <li> ðŸ”´ Doesn't support smart contracts by design; they are possible only by using parachains connecting to the main chain - which probably means they are less refined/harder to work with ðŸ”´ </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

</ul>

Ethereum is not considered because of the upcoming merge (which may or may not break the application), as well as (currently?) ridiculous fees, transaction speed and scalability
