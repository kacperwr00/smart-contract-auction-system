This directory should contain mulitple hello world style smart contract applications (possibly with both transaction processors and client interface) developed with different block chains to help me choose the right one for the main application

Currently considered blockchains include:
<ul>
    <li>Polkadot:
        <ul>
            <li>a </li>
            <li>b </li>
            <li>c </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Solana</li>
    <li>EOS</li>
    <li>Hyperledger Sawtooth</li>
</ul>

Ethereum is not considered because of the upcoming merge (which may or may not break the application), as well as (currently) ridiculous fees, transaction speed and scalability
