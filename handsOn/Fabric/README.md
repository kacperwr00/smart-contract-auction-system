# Getting to know Hyperledger Fabric

References:

Basic information about Hypreledger Fabric:

* wiki page including "Getting Started with Hyperledger Fabric" : <https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric/>

Hello world can be found here:

* Install : <https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>
* Run an example network : <https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html>
* Develop own smart contract : <https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy_chaincode.html>
* Key concepts - long, but exhaustive explanation of Fabric Networks : <https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/key_concepts.html>

I did not find any useful scripts I could write here, unlike with Sawtooth. The example is more thorough than Sawtooth's, explanations and usage of the examples are user friendly, if a bit too high level.

An example auction system project:

* "Build Your Own NFT with Hyperledger Fabric: Session Two" organized by the hyperledger foundation : <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGXOM3KxDyw> - would strongly recommend
* Session one of the workshop dealing with the basics (definitions, high-level overview) : <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEegXLrNr4>
* Open source auction system used in the session above : <https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/nft-auction> (incomplete)
